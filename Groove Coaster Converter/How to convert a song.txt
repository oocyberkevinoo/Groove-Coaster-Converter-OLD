How to convert a song ?

1- Place the songs in the "songs" folder.
2- Launch Groove Coaster Converter and select a Conversion program
3- Insert the song folder's name
4- Follow instructions relative to the Conversion you want.
	(Switch for Example need you to select a folder to place your song)
5- Wait for the program to ask you for another song to close the program, your song is converted.


6- FOR CONVERSIONS TO SWITCH VERSION :
	It will be directly placed as a LayeredFS mod for Atmosphere 0.10 inside the switch folder.
	Place it at the root of your SD Card, and it's done !
	(if you use a older version of Atmosphere, you have to manually rename the "contents" folder to "titles")
	(if you use another Switch CFW, follow their isntructions for installing mods.)
